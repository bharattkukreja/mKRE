/*

The Probe Helper implements the logic of a container image that converts
asynchronous event delivery to a synchronous call. An external probe can call
this to get e2e event delivery success rate and latency. Concretely, the Probe
Helper is able to send and receive events. It exposes an HTTP endpoint which
forwards probe requests to different destinations, and waits for events to be
delivered back to it.

The Probe Helper can handle multiple different types of probes.

1. Broker E2E Delivery Probe

	The Probe Helper receives an event, forwards it to a Broker, and waits for it
	to be delivered back.

                                                      4. (event)
                                   ----------------------------------------------------
                                  |                                                   |
                                  v                                                   |
	Probe ---(event)-----> ProbeHelper ----(event)-----> Broker ------> trigger ------
							 1.                           2.             3. (blackbox)

2. CloudPubSubSource Probe

	The Probe Helper receives an event, publishes it as a message to a Cloud
	Pub/Sub topic, and waits for it to be delivered back wrapped in a CloudEvent
	from a CloudPubSubSource.

3. CloudStorageSource Probe

	This probe involves multiple steps executed in sequence which are intended to
	test all of the different Cloud Storage events which the CloudStorageSource is
	triggered on.

	1. The Probe Helper receives an event with a given ID, writes an object
		 named with that ID to a Cloud Storage bucket, and waits to be notified of
		 the object having been finalized by a CloudStorageSource.
	2. The Probe Helper receives an event with the same ID as in step 1, modifies
		 the same object's metadata, and waits to be notified of the object's
		 metadata having been updated by a CloudStorageSource.
	3. The Probe Helper receives an event with the same ID as in step 1, archives
		 the object, and waits to be notified that the object has been archived by a
		 CloudStorageSource.
	4. The Probe Helper receives an event with the same ID as in step 1, deletes
		 the object, and waits to be notified that the object has been deleted by a
		 CloudStorageSource.

4. CloudSchedulerSource Probe

		This probe is unlike the others in that it does not measure e2e delivery
		by sending and receiving uniquely identifiable events. Instead, it depends
		on an existing CloudSchedulerSource which sinks an event to the Probe Helper
		receiver every minute.

		The Probe Helper receives an event of type `cloudschedulersource-probe`, and
		compares the delay between the current time and the last observed Cloud Scheduler
		tick. The probe fails if the delay exceeds a threshold.

5. CloudAuditLogsSource Probe

	The Probe Helper receives an event, creates a Pub/Sub topic named after it,
	and waits to observe its creation having been logged by a CloudAuditLogsSource.

6. PingSource Probe

	This is similar to the CloudSchedulerSource Probe.

	The Probe Helper receives an event of type `pingsource-probe`, and
	compares the delay between the current time and the last observed PingSource
	tick. The probe fails if the delay exceeds a threshold.
