# Overview

This pod is used to measure unreceived (but accepted) message sends.

# Details

This pod is designed to be both an event sender and an event receiver. It sends
a series of events through a single threaded sender, keeping track of the
response code for each send. The receiver maintains a list of received events.
When stopped, the receiver then waits several minutes for all events to be
delivered.

The ranges of events successfully sent and received are then compared, with any
mismatches seen. It is expected that no events will have been successfully sent,
but not received. These are returned as failures. It is possible (on the other
hand) that an event may not have been successfully sent, but will be received.
For instance, if the ingress of a broker is killed after it enqueues onto
pubsub, but before the handler returns). These are reported as warnings. The
number of duplicate receive events seen is also reported (no duplicate sends are
made, but reliable forwarders like the broker may forward some events more than
once if they are unsure that the previous forward worked)

The yaml's in this directory hard code it to send to the knative GCP broker for
the default namespace and to receive events via a trigger. As a prerequisite,
the broker must already be configured for this namespace. It must be run as a
deployment with a single pod. They can be deployed with ko apply -f .

This pod then provides a very basic 5 call http "api" to control data taking.
This API can be reached on the pods port 8070 either via kubectl port forwarding
or via a curl pod run inside the cluster.

# Control

- curl sendtracker:8070/ready returns "true" once the sender has successfully
  sent a startup message to the receiver.

- curl sendtracker:8070/start starts sending events to the receiver. After this
  is run, the user should then do whatever perturbations are desired to test
  (upgrades, failure injection, etc)

- curl sendtracker:8070/stop stops sending events to the receiver, but waits a
  configurable time for events to be delivered

- curl sendtracker:8070/resultsready returns "true" once the receiver has
  finished listening, and results are ready.

- curl sendtracker:8070/results returns a human readable summary of the run. The
  first line is "success" if no errors were seen and "failure" if errors were
  seen. The following lines are human readable info about errors, warnings, all
  send results, all events received, and the number of duplicate events seen.

To run again, delete the pod and let the deployment restart it.

# Tuning

There are 3 parameters that can be tuned for the deployment.

- K_SINK - The target for the events. This target should eventually feed these
  events back to the pod.
- DELAY_MS - The time to wait (in milliseconds) between event sends
- POST_STOP_SECS - The time to wait (in seconds) between the user request to
  stop and the receiver stopping to record received events.
